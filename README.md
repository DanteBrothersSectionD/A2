Design And Development-

Theme:
The theme for this website was to make a landing page for a fictional company. I chose Mann Co. which is a fictional weapons supplying comany in the videogame Team Fortress 2.

Colour Scheme:
The colour scheme was a mixture of browns, blacks, cream, white, and grey to achieve a page that ultimalety blends very nicely toghether. The inspiration for this colour scheme was the Team Fortress 2 website
and the Mann Co. update page. 

Cards/Info/Buttons:
The page features 4 spereate cards which all display an image, text to describe said image, and a button that links to another website for more info on that said thing.

Animations:
Added some slick animations to the cards where it has a nice hover effect over them, aswell as a shadow effect around them (giving the illusion that they have been raised up). Also the buttons have there own
hover and click animations which is just an extra bit of polish for the website.

Navbar/Footer:
Simple enough and does the job right.

Font:
The font used was an official Team Fortress 2 font which I found on the TF2 wiki.

Images:
Lastly all the images were found on the Team Fortress 2 wiki/
